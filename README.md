## Advent of Code Solutions

### Overview

This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code challenges in Go and Java programming languages.

### Prerequisites

- Go version 1.16 or higher

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher

### Installation Guide

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/johneliud/advent-of-code.git
  cd advent-of-code

### Usage Instructions

Before being able to run the solutions, you need to acquire the input files for each day's challenge. This has been implemented to fetch the input files from the Advent of Code website instead of having them locally. To proceed, you will need to create an account on the Advent of Code website and obtain your session cookie. Once you have your session cookie, you can set it as an environment variable as demonstrated on the .env.example file.

For more insights on how to acquire your session cookie, visit my [blog post](https://dev.to/johneliud/fetching-advent-of-code-inputs-dynamically-in-go-1c67).
